## Usage

Upon accessing my portfolio webpage, it displays my name, a navigation bar, and a hero photo of my recent trip to Mount Rainier National Park.  

![My portfolio webpage includes a navigation bar, header, and an image Mount Rainier.](./assets/images/ss-readme1.png)

Clicking an item in the navigation bar directs the user to cards with additional information about myself and how to contact me.

At the bottom of the page is a footer that buttons to either email me directly, access my GitHub page, or view my LinkedIn profile.
